# Check for virtualisation bit in /proc/cpuinfo. We're looking for svm (AMD) or VMX (Intel) bits. If neither exist then we cannot continue.
# Typically all CPU's support this, however sometimes people forget to turn them on in the BIOS, or in the case of Virtual Machines, the virtualisation bit isnt always exposed by the hypervisor to the VM.

# Context
# -------
# The context section is used to load variables. This has been built in a specific order so that subsequent variable files override earlier variables.
# This generates a specicifity very similar to what we see in Chef.
# The order is as follows:
#  - OS Family (i.e: Debian, RedHat)
#  - Distribution (i.e: RedHat Enterprise, CentOS, Ubuntu)
#  - LSB name (i.e: Raspbian) - only applicable to Debian-based OS's, and primarily needed to support Raspbian on Raspberry Pi's as its the only place Raspbian is specified
#  - Distribution-Version (i.e: Debian-10)
#  - Hostname (as specificed in inventory file)
#  - Hostname (as read by Ansible)
#  - IP Address

# Remember these are CASE SENSITIVE

# This deals with family-specific variabiles. Store them in /var/family/___.yml
- name: Load OS family specific variables file
  include_vars:
    file: "context/family/{{ansible_os_family}}.yml" # RedHat.yml

    - "context/os/{{ ansible_lsb.id }}.yml" # Raspbian.yml
    - "context/os/{{ ansible_distribution }}.yml" # RedHat.yml
  ignore_errors: true


# This deals with host-specific variabiles. Store them in /var/host/___.yml
- name: Load host specific variables file
  include_vars: "{{ item }}"
  with_first_found:
    - "context/host/{{ ansible_default_ipv4.address }}.yml" # 10.0.0.10.yml
    - "context/host/{{ ansible_hostname }}.yml" # pxe.yml
    - "context/host/{{ inventory_hostname }}.yml" # pxe.yml
  ignore_errors: true


# We load these in blocks to that we dont have to copy every single varialbe into files with a higher specicity.
# Remember:
#   - Variables in more specific files completely overwrite variables loaded before it.
#   - Variables do not concatonate. You must specify the whole variable again.
